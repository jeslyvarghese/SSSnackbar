                        Snackbars are a Android UI component which present a stylish, actionable alert to the user. Google also uses their own iOS snackbar implementation in some of their iOS apps, such as Gmail.

                        Snackbar's are useful for presenting a brief message to the user which they can then act on. A common usage pattern is to display a snackbar after a user has performed some destructive action, providing the user with a grace period during which they can undo this action.
